I thought it would take me a little longer than it did but I think that was because my initial estimate was a little conservative.  The longest amount
of time was spent figuring out how the code worked and where to insert changes rather than actually determining how to make the changes.

I thought the project was good and for Part 1 I didn't see anything that needed or could have benefited from any improvements.
